#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Outer apptainer-exec wrapper for scitex-writer's self-hosted CI.
#
# Runs ON THE RUNNER (outside the SIF). Resolves apptainer + the SIF image, then
# `apptainer exec`s the SIF and hands off to an INNER script (run inside the
# container). Keeps every workflow job's YAML down to one line —
# `bash .github/ci/exec-in-sif.sh <inner-script> [args...]` — and concentrates
# all the SIF plumbing (apptainer resolution, ~-expansion, scratch, binds) in
# one version-controlled place.
#
# HOST-AGNOSTIC. This script is NOT Spartan-only: it auto-adapts to whichever
# self-hosted runner picks the job up, keyed off what actually exists on the box.
#
#   * Spartan HPC — the GPFS project dir /data/gpfs/projects/punim0264 EXISTS:
#     apptainer comes from the ~/.env-3.11 shim named by SCITEX_CI_APPTAINER,
#     apptainer scratch lives on the GPFS project, and punim0264 is bound into
#     the container ($HOME/.scitex there is a symlink into it, so without the
#     bind the symlink dangles inside the SIF).
#
#   * Local compute nodes (scitex-compute-01..04) — NO /data/gpfs at all:
#     apptainer is the distro package on PATH (/usr/bin/apptainer), scratch is
#     host-local under $HOME/.cache/scitex-ci, and the GPFS bind is OMITTED
#     (apptainer refuses a bind whose source does not exist, and `mkdir -p` on a
#     GPFS scratch path would hard-fail here under `set -e`).
#
# Each of those three decisions (interpreter, scratch, bind) is made
# INDEPENDENTLY from a probe of this host, so a runner that matches neither
# profile exactly still gets a coherent command line.
#
# Env (set by the workflow from repo Actions Variables):
#   SCITEX_CI_APPTAINER   OPTIONAL path to an apptainer shim
#                         (e.g. ~/.env-3.11/bin/apptainer). Honoured when it
#                         points at an executable; otherwise apptainer is taken
#                         from PATH.
#   SCITEX_CI_SIF         REQUIRED path to the CI SIF image
#                         (e.g. ~/.scitex/dev/containers/ci-cpu.sif)
#
# Usage:
#   bash .github/ci/exec-in-sif.sh run-in-sif.sh 3.12
#
# Fail-loud (operator directive): if NEITHER the shim nor PATH yields an
# apptainer, or the SIF is missing, that is a HARD error naming what was tried
# — never a silent fallback to a bare-runner install.
